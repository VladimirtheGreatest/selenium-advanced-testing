# selenium-advanced-testing
This technical task is designed to test my knowledge and approach to a real-life project scenario.


I used selenium-webdriver and Mocha. Due to my horrible internet connection there are pretty big timeouts and I also used many driver.sleep methods just to make sure everything works correctly even with lags.
